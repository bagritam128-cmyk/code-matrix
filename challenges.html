            <h1>Oil Spills</h1>
Oil spills are one of the most destructive ocean hazards, often caused by tanker accidents, offshore drilling, or pipeline leaks. When oil spreads across the water surface, it blocks sunlight and oxygen, suffocating marine plants and animals. Sea birds, fish, and mammals suffer from toxic exposure, while coastlines face long-term damage. Cleaning up oil spills is extremely challenging and expensive, often taking years to restore ecosystems.

            <h1>Marine Debris & Plastics</h1>
The growing amount of plastic and debris in oceans poses a severe threat to marine life. Items like fishing nets, bottles, and microplastics are ingested by fish, turtles, and seabirds, leading to injuries or death. These plastics also disrupt the marine food web and eventually enter the human food chain. Since plastic is non-biodegradable, it can persist for hundreds of years, forming massive garbage patches in oceans.

            <h1>Climate Change & Warming Seas</h1>
Climate change has caused rising sea surface temperatures, which disturb the delicate balance of marine ecosystems. Coral reefs, known as the “rainforests of the sea,” are highly vulnerable and undergo bleaching when exposed to heat stress. Warmer oceans also fuel stronger cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons, causing destruction to coastal communities. Additionally, melting polar ice contributes to rising sea levels, threatening low-lying islands.

           <h1>Overfishing & Habitat Loss</h1>
Overfishing is depleting fish populations faster than they can reproduce, putting marine biodiversity at risk. The use of destructive techniques like bottom trawling damages seabeds and coral reefs, which serve as essential habitats for countless species. This disrupts the balance of marine ecosystems and reduces food security for millions who depend on fish as a primary protein source. Combined with habitat destruction from coastal development, many species are facing decline or extinction.
